=head1 NAME

Tangerine::Hook - A simple hook class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyHook;
    use parent 'Tangerine::Hook';
    use Tangerine::HookData;
    use Tangerine::Occurence;

    sub run {
        my ($self, $s) = @_;
        if ($s->[0] eq 'use' && $self->type eq 'compile' &&
            $s->[1] && $s->[1] eq 'MyModule') {
            return Tangerine::HookData->new(
                modules => { MyModule => Tangerine::Occurence->new },
            )
        }
        return
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hooks are the workhorses of Tangerine, examining the actual code and
returning L<Tangerine::HookData> where applicable.

Every hook has a type, which can be one of 'package', 'compile' or
'runtime', set by the caller and determining what she is interested in.

Every hook should implement the C<run> method which is passed an array
reference containing the significant children (see L<PPI::Statement>)
of the currently parsed Perl statement.

The caller expects a L<Tangerine::HookData> instance defining what
C<modules> of the requested C<type> we found, what C<hooks> the caller
should register or what C<children> shall be examined next.  Either or
all these may be returned at once.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<type>

Returns or sets the hook type.  May be one of C<package>, C<compile>
or C<runtime>.

=item C<run>

This is called by L<Tangerine> with an array reference containing the
significant children of the currently parsed Perl statement.  Returns a
L<Tangerine::HookData> instance.

Every hook needs to implement this method.
