0.17 2015-05-15
- Added [GithubMeta] to dist.ini, so the repo will be listed in the
  dist metadata, and also [MetaJSON], so the release will include a
  META.json file.  Thanks to Neil Bowers
- Ported the testsuite to the new API introduced in 0.15

0.16 2015-05-13

- No longer ignore numeric module names.  Apparently it's allowed in
  some situations.

0.15 2015-04-24

- The utility now lives in its own distribution, App::Tangerine
- Renamed provides/requires/uses methods to package/require/compile;
  the old method names are still available but consider them deprecated
- Renamed the hook types respectively, from prov/req/use to
  package/require/compile; this is an internal change
- Mode accepts the new type names; also, these are now preferred
- Drop Mo in favour of a simple object system, cutting the dependency chain
- Simplified module name filtering so it actually works like it should
- Fixed a nasty bug with explicit zero version requirements
- Updated documentation

0.14 2015-03-30

 - Mooselike should now parse extends/with statements enclosed in parens
   somewhat better

0.13 2015-02-24

 - Inline is now processed but its own specialized hook, hopefully supporting
   all the import cases properly (for our purposes at least)
 - Added support for Module::Runtime and its subs
 - POD fixes

0.12 2015-01-12

 - Add support for Test::Requires and superclass
 - Update copyright notices
 - stripquotelike() now explodes anonymous hashes too
 - The XXX hook now doesn't require YAML on empty imports
 - `use Inline ()' now works somewhat better

0.11 2014-11-26

 - Moose-like support rewritten -- we now detect versions and avoid indirect
   object method calls
 - aliased fixed; it now only reports the first module in the list, duh
 - We no longer report obvious filenames, really
 - The required version of perl can be an integer as well, duh again
 - List constructors spread over multiple lines are now processed correctly
 - Package names ending in :: are now reported without this suffix

0.10 2014-10-15

 - New internal hook API
 - Support for use_ok, require_ok, syntax_ok from various test distributions,
   and for "use ok" added

   filesnames or variables
