Something to work on:

* Parse EXPR form of eval
* Test::Requires
* syntax_ok() from Test::Strict
* Don't report require statements with filenames or variables
* A new Tangerine method to report required perl version
* Allow users to specify additional hooks to run
* Support "use XXX -dumper/-yaml/-with <module>"
