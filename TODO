Something to work on:

* Parse EXPR form of eval
* Test::Requires
* A new Tangerine method to report required perl version
* Allow users to specify additional hooks to run
* Deal with "use base Exporter::" and similar somehow
* Convert versions in use statements as required, e.g.
  use Exporter 5.7012345_6789 tries to load
  Exporter 5.701234568
* Support Module::Runtime (e.g. use_module())
* Moose's `with' can be interpreted as a hash, with module
  names as keys and hashrefs (with -version => VER and
  possibly other stuff) as their values.  Currently we
  report the hashrefs as modules.
