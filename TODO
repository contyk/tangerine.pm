Something to work on:

* Parse EXPR form of eval
* A new Tangerine method to report required perl version
* Allow users to specify additional hooks to run
* Convert versions in use statements as required, e.g.
  use Exporter 5.7012345_6789 tries to load
  Exporter 5.701234568
* The script is a mess; refactor it
* The script also needs a manpage
* Consider adding some handy CPAN::Meta* support
