Something to work on:

* Parse EXPR form of eval
* A new Tangerine method to report required perl version
* Allow users to specify additional hooks to run
* Convert versions in use statements as required, e.g.
  use Exporter 5.7012345_6789 tries to load
  Exporter 5.701234568
* The script is a mess; refactor it
* The script also needs a manpage
* Consider adding some handy CPAN::Meta* support
* Consider adding support for inc::Module::Install,
  e.g. create mapping between Module::Install subs and
  the modules providing them
* Add difference support:

* Support Module::Load
* Support Prima
