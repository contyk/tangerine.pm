Something to work on:

Features:

* Parse EXPR form of eval
* A new Tangerine method to report required perl version
* Allow users to specify additional hooks to run
* Consider adding some handy CPAN::Meta* support
* Consider adding support for inc::Module::Install,
  e.g. create mapping between Module::Install subs and
  the modules providing them
* Support Prima
* See what we can do about `use base __PACKAGE__->subroutine(...),
  which at the moment detects `subroutine' as a module name.
