Tangerine - Examine perl files and report dependency metadata
-------------------------------------------------------------

Tangerine examines perl files and reports dependency metadata -- provided
modules, and both compile-time and run-time dependencies, along with line
numbers, versions and possibly other related information.

Currently, PPI is used for the initial parsing and statement extraction.

There's also a utility of the same name available.  See the App::Tangerine
distribution.
